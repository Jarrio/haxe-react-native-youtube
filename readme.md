React-Native-Youtube-Player
==============

A simple haxe react-native extern to enable the youtube player.
To get this working you will need to setup react-native and haxe-react-native

Tested on:
- React-native: 0.40.0

To install from git run the following command:

`haxelib git haxe-react-native-youtube https://github.com/Jarrio/haxe-react-native-youtube.git`

add a reference to the lib in your `common.hxml` file (`-lib haxe-react-native-youtube`) and then import the lib into your file.

Once those have been setup you should follow the setup instructions over at https://github.com/inProgress-team/react-native-youtube for your designated platform and use in the same way presented on that page
